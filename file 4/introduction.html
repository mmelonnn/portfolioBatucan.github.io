        been a tender and loving soulmate before he had left for the wars,<br><br> but ever since he 
        returned home he was cross, angry, and unpredictable.<br><br> She was almost afraid to live with

        know and love.<br><br> When one ailment or another bothered people in her village,<br><br> they would often 
        rush for a cure to a hermit who lived deep in the mountains.<br><br> Not Yun Ok.<br><br> She always prided 
        herself that she could heal her own troubles. <br><br>But this time was different. <br><br><b>She was desperate.</b></p>
